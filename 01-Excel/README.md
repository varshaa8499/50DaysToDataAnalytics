## ðŸ“˜ What I've Learned So Far

### âœ… 1. What is Excel and a Brief History
Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet program developed by Microsoft, first released in **1985**.  
It allows users to:
- Store and organize data in **rows and columns**
- Perform **mathematical calculations** and **data analysis**
- Create **charts, graphs, and pivot tables**

It has evolved to become a powerful tool for professionals in many fields including finance, analytics, business, and engineering.

### âœ… 2. How to Install Excel
To install Microsoft Excel:
- Visit [https://www.office.com](https://www.office.com)
- Sign in with your Microsoft account
- Click **"Install Office"**
- Download and install the Office Suite

Alternatively, use the **free web version** of Excel at [office.com](https://www.office.com).

### âœ… 3. Created a Basic Table
I created a basic table with headers like `Skill`, `Difficulty`, etc., and filled in the rows with data.  
Formatted it using:
- **Ctrl + T** or
- **Format as Table** from the toolbar

This helps manage data easily with filtering, sorting, and consistent formatting.

### âœ… 4. How to Add Multiple Rows at Once
Steps:
1. Select the number of rows you want to add
2. Right-click the selection
3. Click **Insert**

New rows are added above the selected range.

### âœ… 5. How to Use the AutoFill Feature
The AutoFill feature helps copy or continue a pattern:
- Enter a value (e.g., `1`) in a cell
- Drag the **small square** at the cell's bottom-right corner downward or across
- Excel continues the sequence (e.g., 2, 3, 4...) or copies the value

### âœ… 6. How to Use the `=` Formula for Basic Addition
In Excel:
- Use `=` to begin any formula
- Example: `=A1 + B1` adds values from cells A1 and B1
- Use `=SUM(A1:A5)` to add values in a range
