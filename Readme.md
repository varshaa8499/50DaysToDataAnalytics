# 50 Days to Data Analyst 🚀

## 🌱 How I Started

For the past 2–3 months, I’ve been trying to become a good Data Analyst — but I couldn’t stay consistent. I had the vision, the learning materials, and even knew what skills were needed… but something was missing.

Here are the main reasons I struggled:
1. I didn’t have a **strong “why”** — a deep reason to pursue this consistently.
2. My **subconscious mind wasn’t convinced** I could do this.
3. I lacked structure, self-belief, and motivation to push through hard days.

## 💡 What’s Changing Now?

- I now have a clear goal: to become a Data Analyst in **50 Days**.
- I’m documenting this journey *publicly* to stay accountable and inspire others.
- I’ve finally discovered my **“why”** — the reason I’ll keep showing up, no matter what:

   ➤ To gain **financial independence** and freedom of choice  
   ➤ To build a career that allows me to **work from anywhere, on my terms**  
   ➤ To **heal and grow** from my past by creating something meaningful  
   ➤ To **build confidence** in myself — logically, emotionally, and professionally  
   ➤ To **prove to myself** that I am capable, worthy, and unstoppable

## ✍️ Daily Progress

📌 I’ll be uploading my daily learning in folders like:
- `01-Excel`
- `02-SQL`
- `03-Python`
- `04-Data Cleaning`
- `05-Data Visualization`
- `06-Projects`

Every folder has a `README.md` with notes and examples.  
Stay tuned — or follow along if you’re on a similar path!

✨ This is my personal challenge. My 50-day transformation.
And this time, **I’m not giving up.**

# I will make the require changes in coming days if required.
